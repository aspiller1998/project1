Description: This script refreshes a web page URL every 10 seconds to keep information updated.

I though of this script because of a client that was at my internship. They always had the weather displayed on a TV with a NUC running Windows. The information would quickly become outdated, as they didn't have the page refresh often. This script solves that issue.


1. Open script
2. Enter the URL you would like to refresh, Ex.https://weather.com/weather/today/l/bddaa2e44c769512ecd9c78ee09b904927b08fa34b3bed42017b7b0a7f017cdd
3. Ensure the script is runnung
